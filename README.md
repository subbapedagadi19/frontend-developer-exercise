# Frontend Developer Test

Vitals is a large online directory of physicians and patient published reviews and ratings.  As much of our traffic is from organic sources - it is important that we always are focused on creating a high performance web site that leads to the best user experience across a variety of devices.

In this exercise, are going to ask you to implement the design of a potential new page at Vitals.  The page is a new design for a doctor's profile page at Vitals.com.  You will find the mocks for this design, as well as our style guide in the `mocks` folder of this repository.  A sample of the data to be rendered on these pages can be found in the `records.json` file in the root of the repository.

We will be looking for the following:

1. Implementation of syntactically correct HTML and CSS that renders the pages as truthful to the mocks as possible.  Aim for pixel perfect implementation!
2. Use of best practices and methods that result in the fastest time-to-first-paint
3. Well-structured markup that follows best practices for SEO
4. The ability to render the page reasonably on desktop (1440x900) and mobile (iPhone X 375x812)
5. Correct implementation of the interactions described in the mocks

An excellent implementation of this exercise should also be able to demonstrate:

1.  Use of standard tools to optimize the end product including minimization of CSS and JavaScript, etc.
2.  Use of a bare minimum number of 3rd party frameworks to complete the implementation.  While you can use a more advanced framework like React, Vue, or Angular - we are more interested in your ability to complete this exercise using only what the browser provides with a minimum footprint.
3.  An understanding of what GoogleBot/BingBot et. al. might be looking for to understand and index the web page.  While advanced SEO is not required, we should be able to reliably predict what Google will display in the SERP.

To complete the exercise, please fork this repository and when complete, send a link to your completed work based on the fork.  You may use any web server you'd like, but please provide clear instructions on how we can run your exercise so we may evaluate it.

Good luck!
